# AI Darwinism
Survial of the fittest, who's AI will survive? This competition will give the best AI developers in the world a level playing field to discover who can create the best AI. There will be many categories; Robot Fights, Game Battles, Races, and more! Each category will have it's own sub-categories that will include more specific rules and regulations, for example a Game Battle might have a sub-category of Chess. While the Robot Fight category might have a sub-category of Drones. Whatever category and sub-category you pick, you will be prompted with a menu to make a project. You will be given an API to interact with the virtual hardware you are given. Each Sub-Category will have it's own API to interface with the game. While you are developing your AI scipts, you will be able to run your code against a dummy to see how it interacts. The dummy will have multiple modes you can activate to exercise your script. Each ranking system will depend on it's sub-category, but most should have a render of the battle of the AIs.
